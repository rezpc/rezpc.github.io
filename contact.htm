<p>If you'd much rather meet in person, you can join us at our weekly meetings held every
Saturday evening at 8:00pm in the large parking lot across the street from H-E-B and next
door to Blockbuster Video.&nbsp; You can use the following map to see exactly where we are
located at (the red star).&nbsp; We always encourage people to come share their ideas and
show their rides as well, so if you live in the surrounding area, you and your club can
cruise down and come hang out with us.</p>
