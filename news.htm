<p><strong>Wednesday - 12/28/04<br>
</strong><font color="#800000">Website test.</font></p>

<p><strong>Saturday - 2/14/04<br>
</strong><font color="#800000">Happy Valentine's Day!&nbsp; Added an upcoming car show in
San Antonio, and put two video links to Ryan's Blazer.&nbsp; Might be switching webhost
providers in the near future, increasing our storage capacity for more videos if any
member's would like to introduce them.</font></p>

<p><strong>Sunday - 12/14/03<br>
</strong><font color="#800000">Added the Lowrider Magazine Super Show to the event's
section including about a dozen pics as well.&nbsp; Fun show overall, gotta love the
bikini contest.&nbsp; It's been tough trying to keep in contact with Street Image, as I
try to reorganize my life.&nbsp; Way too many options and choices are being presented to
me, it's getting to be real tough finding time for everything I want to do.&nbsp; Hence my
lack of updates and why my ride is still parked in a garage, yearning for my attention.</font></p>

<p><strong>Sunday - 09/28/03<br>
</strong><font color="#800000">It's been awhile since any major update has come along,
hence the large gap in this section.&nbsp; Removed several member profiles, re-arranged
some info in several.&nbsp; Not as major as I had hoped it to be, we're working on getting
some more pictures of the new members up soon.&nbsp; We have some pics of the San Antonio
LRM show held this month, as soon as I get alittle bit more info it will be posted in our
events section.</font></p>

<p><strong>Wednesday - 11/13/02<br>
</strong><font color="#800000">Congratulations to Street Image as we celebrate 11 years of
being strong since the day we began!&nbsp; We recently held our Anniversary gathering this
past weekend, and I've added a new entry to our <a
href="event_gallery/event_galleryc1.htm" target="main">event's section</a> providing over
40 pictures of what took place.&nbsp; Go ahead and check it out, we hope you can join us
the next time we throw a party!</font></p>

<p><strong>Sunday - 09/22/02<br>
</strong><font color="#800000">Finally got the few pics of the San Antonio LRM show up in
the events section and added some more pictures to Jeremy's member section.&nbsp; The San
Antontio show was great, I'm still tired from doing Jeremy's hydraulic installation, but
hopefully I can get some more stuff done to this website.&nbsp; Congrats to Jeremy for
getting second in Mild Street Mini SUV and to Mark and Amy for winning the Dayton Giveaway
contest (get me some rims!)</font></p>

<p><strong>Saturday - 08/24/02<br>
</strong><font color="#800000">Took some pictures this past weekend of some members from
the Seguin chapter and did a complete makeover of the website structure (although you
won't even notice the changes and their importance.)&nbsp; I was kind of disappointed with
the photoshoot as some important people didn't show up... again, so don't expect to see
them on the site anytime soon.&nbsp; Anyway, hopefully within the next few weeks the site
will be broken down into the many chapters we currently have right now, so until then,
please enjoy some of the pictures we have now.</font></p>

<p><strong>Tuesday - 06/04/02<br>
</strong><font color="#800000">Haven't had much time to update the site, but after a few
questions I changed the menu, the Contact Us button to be exact, to switch to a page
instead of just an e-mail.&nbsp; There you can find some important e-mail addresses and a
handy map to show you how to get to our meeting place or &quot;hangout&quot;.&nbsp; We're
also adding a new section to feature ladies and viewer's rides, so send us a pic of your
crazy ride or that bikini flashin' lady to <a href="mailto:admin@streetimage.org">admin@streetimage.org</a>.
&nbsp; Please send all images in .jpg format and with information about the person/vehicle
if applicable.&nbsp; All images will be reviewed before posting.&nbsp; Thanks!</font></p>

<p><strong>Tuesday - 04/16/02<br>
</strong><font color="#800000">Finally got some pictures taken of a few members who showed
up this past weekend for a photo shoot, you can see them in our Member's Section.&nbsp; We
still have a few who don't have pictures, and some who haven't even been added to the
list.&nbsp; Sounds like another topic to bring up at next weekend's meeting.&nbsp; I've
also added some upcoming car shows, both in and out of state, so you might wanna check
those out as well.</font></p>

<p><strong>Monday - 03/05/02<br>
</strong><font color="#800000">Fixed the gallery section so that the images show up in the
same window instead of opening a new window.&nbsp; Haven't added any pictures yet,
hopefully this weekend we can take some of all the new members.</font></p>

<p><strong>Friday - 02/15/02<br>
</strong><font color="#800000">I've wanted to add this section for awhile now, just
haven't had the time.&nbsp; I know it sucks when you visit a website and you don't know
what's been changed and whats still the same, or when new or exciting things have been
added, and whats been updated or modified, so hopefully this will help eliminate that
situation.</font></p>
