<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking for something extra to add to your ride?&nbsp; What better
way than to add custom neon lighting to brighten up those dark, boring cruises down your
favorite strip!&nbsp; Stop using those generic lighter plug-in neons or 12 volt plastic
undercarriage kits and start using what the professionals use!&nbsp; Street Image is proud
to bring to you Street Image motorized trunk and neon accessories!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Street Image brings to you only the best neon products, lighting and
fixtures, from the original undercarriage neon kits to custom neon lighting and
fixtures.&nbsp; When you go open your trunk to show off that sound or hydraulic setup of
yours, do you want a boring neon light plainly staring you in the face, or would you
rather have a sign shining bright saying &quot;I SEE YOU LOOKING&quot; or even &quot;DONT
HATE&quot; to knock people off their feet!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We offer a variety of color selections to choose from.&nbsp; When
ordering neon lights, please keep in mind that the colors shown in chart are as accurate
as the printing process will allow.&nbsp; Street Image cannot accept responsibility for
variations between these colors and illuminated ones.</p>
